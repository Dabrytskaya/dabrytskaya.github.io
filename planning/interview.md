## Portrait

Katia is from Belarus and she <br>
likes to draw, design and <br>
express herself towards art.

She moved to Belgium to <br>
to be with her husband. <br>
She's been living here <br>
for more than 2 years.

She is interested in <br>
web design and that's <br>
the reason she is in <br>
the HackYourFuture. <br>
She wants to learn <br>
more about it and <br>
to start coding too.

She likes to organize <br>
and to manage. <br>
She has interest in <br>
the financial market <br>
and technology companies.

She wants to work in <br>
a big company <br>
where she can learn more <br>
and grow as a professional. 

She is interested in <br>
creating applications and <br>
working with mobile <br>
companies. <br>

## Homepage

Katia likes minimalism, <br>
a clean aesthetic <br>
and she prefer black and white <br>
than colorful. <br>
Her favorite color is green. 

She wants a clean website <br>
with one vertical landing page, <br> 
minimalism aesthetic <br>
and focused in her portfolio.

She wants something very professional <br>
where people can contact her <br>
and hire her.

## Propose

I didn't designed my proposition <br>
yet because I want to understand better <br>
what she needs and wants. 

Right now I propose to have a <br>
homepage with two subpages <br>
one with her contacts and history <br>
and with more of her aesthetic. 

The second subpage I propose <br>
to be more oriented to things <br>
that she and likes the aesthetic. <br>
Something like a pinterest page <br>
to show what inspire her as a <br>
design.
